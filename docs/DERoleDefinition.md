## Executive Summary

This document lays out a proposed standard definition for the role of Distinguished Engineer in Financial Services. Its goal is to provide clarity and consistency across organisations that wish to use it.

The definition has been proposed by a Distinguished Engineer Special Interest Group within the FINOS Community, with the view that other organisations can use it as the basis for their own DE functions.

In terms of scope, the Distinguished Engineer is defined as a senior role focused on technology within the Financial Services industry.

The definition covers three main elements of a DE function:

1. Role Context: The seniority, influence, focus and degree of autonomy to be held by a person appointed a DE.
2. Role Characteristics: The expected activities and contribution of a DE.
3. Individual Competencies: The technical, organisational and behavioural skills required.

This document gives detailed examples of what can and should be included in each of these categories. In recognition of contextual differences that may exist between organisations using this definition, the document also outlines certain key principles that should transcend these differences and be applied across the board.

## Introduction

The title ‘Distinguished Engineer’ has existed for over 40 years as a formal recognition of outstanding technical achievement in software engineering. In that time there has been little attempt to establish consistency across the organisations awarding the title. Consistency can apply to the role itself and what being a DE entails, or in the achievements and competencies required to be awarded the title, or in the process by which this decision is made. 

A number of organisations with an interest in the space, within the Financial Services industry, have come together to address this, with the aim of establishing agreed standards and criteria that would need to be satisfied in order to confer the title ‘Distinguished Engineer’ on an individual working within this industry.

The membership of this group reflects common interests. Many of the awarding organisations are financial services organisations. Also involved are BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, who are dedicated to the professionalisation of Technology-related careers. Davies Group, a consultancy operating in the financial services industry to improve the performance of technologists, is also represented.

This document sets out the definition that has been agreed by this collection of organisations. We do not profess ownership of this definition, and hope other organisations will sign-up to them and seek to improve them where possible. The standards were originally designed in 2017, with a consortium of banks, the BCS, British Telecom and IBM, and have been revisited in 2025, under the newly formed DE Special Interest Group created within the FINOS Community.

The benefits of having an agreed definition apply to organisations using the definition as well as the individuals awarded this status. A common definition gives the DE title currency across organisations, and establishes a sense of reassurance in what can be expected from a Distinguished Engineer (DE). They also allow DEs to plan their career development, giving a clear description of the competencies they are likely to need and the achievements to aim for if they are to become a DE. Organisations involved in the creation of career path frameworks and personal development programmes can incorporate these standards into their initiatives to ensure they achieve their goal. The standards also add much needed clarity on the role and responsibilities of a DE, avoiding confusion and enabling a consistent approach across awarding institutions.

At this stage, the awarding of the DE title is performed by the organisations themselves.  It is hoped that over time, if this standard definition is more widely used, there could be a common accreditation process agreed, to ensure greater consistency and the portability of the title if individuals move between organisations.

## Approach

We recognise that each awarding institution will have its own distinct approach and priorities, and that it will naturally want to impose these on any adopted framework. For example, an organisation may want to place significant emphasis on its core values when defining the role to be performed by a DE. Another may want to incorporate an existing competency framework when defining the competencies expected of a DE. Selection processes may differ in terms of whether a limit is placed on the number of people that can be awarded the title in any one year.

This kind of flexibility is vital if the definition is to be accepted and adopted. The definition has been developed in a way that allows that degree of flexibility while at the same time establishing increased commonality.

This has been achieved by specifying the principles to be observed, rather than the specific ways these principles should be applied.  However, when defining the competencies of a DE the definition sets out three broad areas to be covered and suggests the specific traits, skills and competencies that could articulate each area. These are suggestions, not dictates, for awarding organisations to adopt, but we hope that many indeed do accept the definition largely wholesale.

## 3. Overview of the Definition

The definition covers the three main elements of a DE Function:

### Figure 1: The three elements of a DE Function

![Three Elements of a DE Function](/img/DE_role_definition/three_elements_de_function.png)

### Role Context

This refers to the positioning of the role a DE would occupy upon appointment. It should be significant in terms of scope and impact to require a DE to fulfil it. This ensures a person with the technical capability and track record expected of a DE has the opportunity to put their capability into practice and add significant value to the organisation.

Because of the variation in how roles are defined across organisations, it is not realistic to create a single role profile for Distinguished Engineers. This document lays out the core set of principles to be incorporated in each organisation-specific role definition. These principles define the common ground that constitutes the definition of the DE role comparable across industries.

### Role Characteristics

This refers to the expected activities and contribution of a DE following their appointment. These may be similar to those the DE was already performing, though it is most likely to involve a greater contribution, commensurate with the role. Including these in the definition brings much needed clarity to what a DE is expected to do following appointment, and ensures this is broadly consistent across awarding organisations.

For a role to be considered at the DE level, the majority of these activities should be undertaken. However, given the diversity of organisations appointing DEs, discretion should be allowed as to which if any should be considered mandatory and which could be optional.

### Individual Competencies

The Context and Characteristics of the DE role form the basis of the definition set out here.  To meet these exacting standards, the individual DE must possess the necessary competencies. This forms the third element, though there is greater flexibility in how an awarding organisation specifies these. It is for each organisation to decide which specific competencies are expected and required, though clearly they should be sufficient to allow the DE to perform the role and make the contribution expected of them. They should also align well to the DE Characteristics.  Each organisation must also decide whether these competencies are the ‘entry’ criteria, or whether there will be a period of time during which the DE will be helped to develop any competencies they lack to the required level.

Many organisations already possess detailed competency frameworks, and it is for each to decide how to incorporate the DE role into those. For example, should they specify the same competencies and raise the expected proficiency level to reflect the greater strengths expected of a DE? Or should additional competencies be added to reflect any new contributions to be made by DEs?

While it is for each awarding organisation to decide these questions, it is also important that the integrity of the DE role is maintained by applying universal standards that are higher than might be expected or required in less challenging or less senior technical roles. The definition outlined here gives the range of competencies that should be considered as well as the expected level of proficiency that might be required before an appointment can be made.

By applying this definition, an organisation can be confident that the role is appropriately significant in terms of strategic **context**, that there is clarity on the **characteristics** of that role in terms of what a DE is required to do, and that the person selected has the **competence** to fulfil these requirements.

## Role Context

By applying this definition, an organisation can be confident that the role is appropriately significant in terms of strategic context, that there is clarity on the characteristics of that role in terms of what a DE is required to do, and that the person selected has the competence to fulfil these requirements.

*Principle: The role to be performed by a DE, either before or after appointment, should be appropriately senior and significant in its impact to require a DE to perform it.*

The definition of the role context should include the following four dimensions:

### 1. Seniority

- A senior level engineering role positioned at an Executive level, such as Director, Managing Director, or Senior Vice President in financial services organisations.

### 2. Influence

- Operate at an enterprise-wide level whose advice is actively sought by both internal and external peers and senior management.
- Influence and enable the organisation’s strategic goals through appropriate use of technology.

### 3. Focus

- Focus on the business value that the technology provides. 
- Deliver outputs that make a significant contribution to the organisation’s strategic goals.

### 4. Autonomy

- Own the technology strategy for the business within which they operate.
- Act as a trusted advisor to the business.
- Has the independence and freedom to set direction without political or tactical influence from others.

In addition to the above, the organisation should clearly identify all roles that are deemed ‘DE grade’, irrespective of whether they are filled or not.  There should also be a clear and transparent process to agree new roles that come within this category.

## Role Characteristics

*Principle: The characteristics of the role to be performed by Distinguished Engineers must include a broad range of contributions that reflects the value of the role to the organisation and the industry.*

Organisations may choose to make some of these characteristics mandatory and some optional. The characteristics should include:

### 1. Contributing

- Contribute to the strategic goals of the organisation through the application of technology.

### 2. Solving Problems

- Solve problems through the application of technical knowledge and skill, determining when and how technology can solve business problems.
- Scope and create technical solutions that contribute to the business’s strategic goals.

## Individual Competencies

*Principle: The competencies of a Distinguished Engineer should extend beyond technical excellence and include the ability to influence and collaborate.* 

Three categories of competence should be covered to reflect the ability of DEs to use their technical excellence to the benefit of the enterprise and the industry. The specific traits, skills and competencies within each category can reflect the organisation’s priorities and its existing competency frameworks.

The three categories are shown in Figure 2:

## 7. Conclusion

This document seeks to clarify and promote the role of Distinguished Engineer in financial services. There is no reason why the definition laid out here may not be applied to software engineering roles in other industries. However, given the foothold already established in a number of banks over many years, it was decided to begin the process here and hope that it will be adopted by others within financial services and then potentially outside the industry.

Although generated by people based in Europe, the definition is intended for global use and adoption. The approach adopted was to take advantage of what already existed (in this case a group of people meeting regularly to pursue this goal and a previously defined standard) in the hope that others outside this initial group will make use of the work they have generated.

This kind of flexibility is vital if the definition is to be accepted and adopted. The definition has been developed in a way that allows that degree of flexibility while at the same time establishing increased commonality.
